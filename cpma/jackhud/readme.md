jackhud

made using the superhud editor included with the cpma pack

since this uses superhud it **ONLY WORKS IN CNQ3**

to use, place in your `cpma/hud/` directory, and use the command `ch_file jackhud` for a hud with health and armor bars, OR use the command `ch_file jackhudminimal` for a hud without those bars.
