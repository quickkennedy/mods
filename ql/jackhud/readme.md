a hud i made a while ago. dont remember how nor why. inspired by custom huds from other games like rayshud and hypnotize hud in team fortress 2.

to use it put jackhud.menu in baseq3/ui/, and then either run the included cfg file ("jackhud.cfg") OR create a cfg file with the text

// Config file
{
  loadMenu { "ui/intro.menu" }
  loadMenu { "ui/jackhud.menu" }
}

then just run that config file in-game.
