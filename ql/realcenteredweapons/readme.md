uses weapon-specific commands to offset the on screen viewmodel on the y axis, making it centered. this WILL override your previous weapon-specific scripts, so add them to the back of each command using ";" to separate commands. thanks to bonkmaykr (see CREDITS.md) for recommending to add `wait 45` before every command so that it only changes offsets AFTER you switch weapons.
