# mods
repository originally for my mods/ports to tf2c and tf2, but now i'll probably just post any mod i've made or am working on.
if you'd like to see one of my mods removed, my discord is JackBoi#1758. feel free to contact me either way about errors.

## usage

use this in any way you please. i doubt anyone will, but i dont particularly care if you copy my work, since it just saves others from doing work.
